lol it's never too late to start a changelog, right?

v2.8.8a
- Forgot to resize ammo when there is no clip. It's a separate element from ammo in clip, and ammo in reserve
- Realigned the "resume", "find a game", and "disconnect" button texts
- Changed "find a game"'s background to no longer be an eyesore (changed from tan to green)

v2.8.8
- Fixed a typo that made RED's scoreboard censor bar 2% wider than BLU's in streamer mode
- Repositioned scoreboard censor bars to accommodate new HUD scaling functionality
- Fixed sizing on health and ammo in clip to accommodate new HUD scaling functionality
- Added backstabs back to the scoreboard
- Realigned scoreboard stats to be consistent across all three columns (let me know if damage easily grows too large and overlaps its label!)

v2.8.7a
- Resized scoreboard censor bars on streamer mode to reveal friend icon

v2.8.7
- Removed weapon names from disguises on streamer mode
- Resized scoreboard censor bars on streamer mode

- Changed killstreak counter color and crit counter for Diamondback, Frontier Justice, Manmelter color from off-white to white to better fit theme

v2.8.6

v2.8.5
- Fixed floating health numbers being cut off
- Fixed Huntsman having two charge meters
- Moved Loose Cannon, Stickybomb Launcher, and Huntsman charge meters to be in line with other classes'

- Correctly repositioned shadow for killstreak counter
- Slightly repositioned heads counter to be in line with killstreak counter
- Moved ubercharge meter to center of screen for visibility
- Restylized the Vaccinator charges similar to other meters
- Moved secondary targetID (healing/healer) up to accommodate Medic's ubercharge meter move and other existing item effect meters

- Please don't ask about the Phlog. I still have no idea why it's off to the side.

- Adjusted scoreboard HUD from "minmode" sizing to full sizing for 24 player servers.
